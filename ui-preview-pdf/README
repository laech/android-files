Provides support for previewing PDF files using pdfium.

To build pdfium, see https://bitbucket.org/lae/pdfium and the android branch.
Then copy the resulting libpdfium.so files for different architectures to jni/lib,
copy the /public header files to jni/include, to build this module, run ndk-build
under the jni folder manually, because the Android Gradle plugin doesn't support
linking with prebuilt libs. jniLibs is linked to the output libs folder.

Not using PdfRenderer (also uses pdfium) on Android because:

  * It is only available since API 21.

  * Native crashes the process sometime after opening a bad or encrypted PDF.
    https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=91625

  * After upgrading to Android M, some PDFs are not showing text anymore.

So pdfium is bundled in the app, to avoid the above issues. Sadly it's not thread safe.
